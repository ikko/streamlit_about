#### Overview of Decision Trees

Decision trees are supervised learning models utilized for problems involving classification and regression. High flexibility is presented by tree models, which allows for the capture of complex non-linear relationships. However, a potential downside is noted, as trees are prone to memorizing the noise present in a dataset.

#### Ensemble Methods

By aggregating the predictions of trees that are trained differently, ensemble methods are employed to take advantage of the flexibility of trees while reducing their tendency to memorize noise. These methods are applied across a variety of fields and are recognized for a proven track record of success in many machine learning competitions.

#### Course Objectives

In this course, the use of Python for training decision trees and tree-based models with the user-friendly scikit-learn machine learning library is addressed. The advantages and shortcomings of trees are understood, demonstrating how ensembling can alleviate these limitations while practicing on real-world datasets. Additionally, the tuning of the most influential hyperparameters is explored to maximize model performance.
