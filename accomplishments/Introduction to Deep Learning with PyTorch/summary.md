#### Understanding the Power of Deep Learning

Deep learning is utilized in various applications such as smartphone cameras, voice assistants, and self-driving cars. It is also employed in the discovery of protein structures and in achieving victories over humans in the game of Go. This powerful technology is explored, and methods to leverage it using PyTorch, one of the most popular deep learning libraries, are examined.

#### Train Your Neural Network

The distinction between deep learning and "classic" machine learning is addressed initially. Knowledge regarding the training process of a neural network is acquired, alongside the creation of a training loop. Loss functions are developed for both regression and classification problems, and PyTorch is utilized to calculate their derivatives.

#### Evaluate and Improve Your Model

In the latter part, various hyperparameters are studied that can be adjusted to enhance model performance. Understanding of the different components of a neural network is deepened, enabling the creation of larger and more complex architectures. Model performance is measured using TorchMetrics, a library in PyTorch dedicated to model evaluation.

Upon completion, the ability to leverage PyTorch for solving classification and regression problems on both tabular and image data through deep learning is attained. This capability is considered vital for experienced data professionals who seek to progress in their careers.
