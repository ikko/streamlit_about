#### Introduction to Big Data and PySpark

Big Data has garnered considerable attention over recent years and is recognized as mainstream among many companies. The concept of Big Data is examined within this course through the lens of PySpark. Spark is identified as a "lightning fast cluster computing" framework designed for Big Data applications, offering a general data processing platform engine. Programs are permitted to run up to 100 times faster in memory and 10 times faster on disk compared to Hadoop.

The course emphasizes the use of PySpark, a Python package specifically created for Spark programming, along with its robust higher-level libraries such as SparkSQL and MLlib, which is utilized for machine learning tasks. 

#### Practical Applications

Participants engage in practical analyses that include exploration of the works of William Shakespeare, analysis of FIFA 2018 data, and clustering of genomic datasets. 

#### Conclusion

An in-depth understanding of PySpark and its applicability to general Big Data analysis is acquired by the conclusion of the course.
