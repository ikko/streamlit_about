#### Unsupervised Learning Overview

A collection of customers with various characteristics, such as age, location, and financial history, is analyzed to discover patterns and sort them into clusters. Alternatively, a set of texts, such as Wikipedia pages, is segmented into categories based on content. This process is identified as unsupervised learning, characterized by the absence of guiding or supervisory tasks for pattern discovery, and focuses on uncovering hidden structures from unlabeled data. 

#### Techniques in Unsupervised Learning

A variety of techniques in machine learning is encompassed by unsupervised learning, including clustering, dimension reduction, and matrix factorization. The fundamentals of unsupervised learning are covered in this course, along with the implementation of essential algorithms utilizing scikit-learn and SciPy. 

#### Course Outcomes

Skills are developed to cluster, transform, visualize, and extract insights from unlabeled datasets. The course culminates with the construction of a recommender system designed to suggest popular musical artists.
