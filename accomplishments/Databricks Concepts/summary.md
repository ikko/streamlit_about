#### Learn the Power of the Lakehouse  
The need for data-driven tools in todayâ€™s data-filled world is recognized. Guidance is provided from start to finish on how the Databricks Lakehouse Platform serves as a single, scalable, and performant platform for data processes. Engagement with a real-world dataset teaches the accomplishment of various tasks within the Databricks platform. Initial learning focuses on the administration of the Databricks platform and the establishment of a secure environment.

#### Practice Scalable Data Engineering  
After the workspace setup, the creation of powerful data pipelines using Databricks is instructed. Different transformations are applied to the dataset, facilitating its movement from Bronze to Silver and then Gold in a Medallion architecture. The provision of readily available compute power and scalability by Databricks clusters is also understood. An end-to-end Databricks Workflow is established to automate the entire data pipeline.

#### Use the Lakehouse as Your Data Warehouse  
A fundamental component of the Lakehouse architecture is the ability to query data storage similarly to a traditional data warehouse. In this section, Databricks SQL is explored to achieve desired data warehousing performance on top of a data lake. Instruction includes the creation of queries using standard ANSI SQL, and the utilization of those results to develop ad-hoc dashboards across the entire dataset.

#### Implement Governed Data Science and Machine Learning  
Comprehensive tools for data science and machine learning use cases provided by Databricks are learned. Tracking and evaluation of models occur using the fully integrated MLFlow framework for MLOps. The usage of the Feature Store and Model Registry is highlighted as it simplifies the creation of production-quality machine-learning models. Deployment and monitoring of models utilizing built-in model serving capabilities is also instructed.
